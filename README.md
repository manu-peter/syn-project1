Build and deploy a simple web application on AWS EC2 using Docker.

Requirements:

* Create a Dockerfile to build a Docker image of a simple web application (e.g., a static HTML page). You can use either HTTPD / NGINX.

* Push the Docker image to an Docker HUB repository.

* Deploy the Docker image to an AWS EC2 instance using the Docker CLI.

* Configure basic security for the EC2 instance (e.g., SSH key-based authentication).

* Implement basic monitoring using Prometheus to track CPU and memory usage of the EC2 instance.
